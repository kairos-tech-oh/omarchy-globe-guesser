// Globe Guesser: the game, the two network calls it makes, and the one small
// file it keeps.
//
// The map and the globe never touch the network -- they are drawn from bundled
// Natural Earth outlines in GlobeMap.qml -- so the guessing half of the game
// works with the machine offline. Only the photograph needs a connection, and
// it comes from Wikimedia Commons, anonymously and without an API key.
//
// Two requests per round, both described at the Process that issues them:
//
//   1. one api.php query returning candidate photos near a city, each with its
//      own coordinates, licence and author
//   2. one download of the single chosen photo to a private directory
//
// The downloaded file is what Image renders. Image.source is never pointed at a
// network URL: the address arrives inside an API response, so it is
// attacker-influenced, and a remote Image would hand that response an unbounded
// fetch and decode inside the shared, long-lived shell process.
